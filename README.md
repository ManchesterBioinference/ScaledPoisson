# ScaledPoisson
This repo has code and data related to our work on scaled Poisson mixture model applied to cluster single-cell ATAC-seq data taking into accunt sequencing depth variation of individial cells.

## Synthetic data:
The uploaded archive for synthetic data is a csv file, unzip it before running. In the CSV file, cells are in the rows and peaks are in the columns.

Also provided the original clustering labels for this data.
